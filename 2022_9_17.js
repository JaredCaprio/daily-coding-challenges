/* 1. Task

Coding in function pickIt, function accept 1 parameter:arr, it's a number array, we need traverse arr by using for loop, if element is odd number, push it to array odd, if it's a even number, push it to array even.

I've defined two array odd and even in the function, and also wrote the return statement. your work is write a for loop.

If you forgot how to push an element to array, please refer to lesson 4.*/
function pickIt(arr){
  var odd=[],even=[];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if (arr[i] % 2 === 0){
      even.push(arr[i])
    } else {
      odd.push(arr[i])
    }
  }
  
  
  return [odd,even];
}
